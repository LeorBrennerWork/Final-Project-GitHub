PROBLEMS:
1. First ciphertext (also after reset) is correct but txd is problematic.
2. Subsequent ciphertexts are usually incorrect but txd matches.
3. Rxd doesnt work as intended after the first time or first few times.

SOLUTIONS:
1. Fix starting conditions for txd
2. Fix ciphertext sync (when more time given for cipher to run the results are better)
3. Fix rxd sync. Maybe wipe all data after a certain number of clk cycles that there is no new activity? There seems to be no problem when data is enter all in one string.


1. Syncronizer on the handshake signal (after all the PC and the FPGA use different clocks).
2. SM for when I am receiving, processing, IDLE or transmitting.
3. Work with faster Baud Rates. 
4(?). Maybe change conditions/configurations in RealTerm.
